However, they noted that they were organizing claims for users with suspended X accounts, directing them to fill out a form on Discord. If you missed the main claim period or have a suspended account, you may still have a chance to claim by contacting the Kaito team through their Discord channel. Unclaimed tokens from the initial airdrop are reportedly being redistributed to the community in a second season, but no specific details on this process are available yet.
