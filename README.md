# 📊 Campaign Management Repository

This repository is designed to organize and manage marketing or data campaigns.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each campaign is organized into a **separate folder**.

### Inside Each Campaign Folder:
- `raw_data/` — contains raw data files used in the campaign.
- `code/` — includes scripts (e.g., Python, SQL, etc.) for data processing or analysis.
- `README.md` — a short description of the campaign and a link to the associated Google Sheet or dashboard.

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the campaign you're interested in.
2. Read the local `README.md` for context and access to the relevant data or outputs.
